    "### Problem understanding and use case:\n",
    "\n",
    "This analysis consists of three different data sources on population growth, dwelling and household type. Merging these three datasets can give us answers to the following questions:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. How is the demand of housing going to change in Melbourne?\n",
    "2. Will the housing industry going to keep pace with the growing population?\n",
    "3. What would be the preferred household format in the future?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Further analysis (optional):**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Identify opportunity to build houses in growing areas - Urban Planning\n",
    "2. Identify residential areas preference for different demographics\n",
    "3. Property pricing estimates based on location\n",
    "\n",
    "This analysis will shed some light on such questions.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Whom will this analysis help?**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Buyers, Sellers or Renter of property (Also real estate agents)\n",
    "2. House loans and Mortgage providers - Banks & second Mortgage companies\n",
    "3. Property Builders\n",
    "4. Goverment/ City Council - Urban planners\n",
    "    * Periodic re-alignments of boundaries attempt to rationalize these situations and adjust the deployment of assets and resources. \n",
    "    * The council also looks to the city's goals, major projects and infrastructure improvements ranging from community growth to land use to finances and strategic planning.\n",
    "    * Identify areas of homeless people (Maybe)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Some definations and context around the problem:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Words definations:**\n",
    "\n",
    "* Dwelling: A structure or a discrete space within a structure intended for people to live in or where a person or group of people live. Thus a structure that people actually live in is a dwelling regardless of its intended purpose, but a vacant structure is only a dwelling if intended for human residence. A dwelling may include one or more rooms used as an office or workshop provided the dwelling is in residential use. \n",
    "\n",
    "* Non-Private Dwelling:  Examples of the information collected are: Hotel, motel; Boarding house, private hotel, public hospital (not psychiatric) and child care institution\n",
    "\n",
    "* Private Dwelling: Such as houses and flats\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Use cases:**\n",
    "\n",
    "* Data on dwelling structure are used to monitor changes in housing characteristics, to help formulate housing policies and to review existing housing stock. \n",
